# Challenge-N3-PasswordGen
Generate your new personalized password with one click!

## **ABOUT THE PROJECT**

This password generator uses input elements to generate a random password. The code still needs refinement and it's a little repetitive. The inclusion of emojis in the passwords resulted in some errors, due to the .plit and .slice methods tha tend to cut the emojis in half from a string.
